# Drawiz
This project was made at EarthxHack 2020

### Challenge
How might educational institutions for all ages continue to provide the best educational opportunities possible for all students, especially those that are underserved and donâ€™t always have access to the latest technology?

### Solution
Mobile-friendly quiz software with ability to upload answers through photos, great for underserved students that have to turn in their quizzes and homework remotely.

## Story

### Inspiration
I love anything that can help people learn more easily. I talked with a few mentors from sponsor UT Dallas at EarthxHack 2020, they mentioned that they would like to reduce prep time for online exams that involve graphing equations on paper. The main problem is the test itself and the way to answer questions are in more than one location, and it takes time to gather all of it in one place.

### What it does
1) Displays quiz questions
2) Uploads your image file with answers
3) Crops images
4) Assigns cropped image to question
5) Displays your answers next to the question for easy review

### How I built it
1) Drew the design skeleton, just the placement of all the components
2) Made prototype with basic design and filler data
3) Layering functionality, piece by piece, like grains of rice, I made it work
4) Beautified it with Bootstrap

### Challenges I ran into
There wasn't enough time for me to make all the features I wanted to make, so I had to down-size my specifications.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of the fact that I made an app that works and looks pretty within the time constraints.

### What I learned
I learned how to use a JavaScript cropping library.

### What's next for Drawiz
1) Send an email with form content
2) Have a teacher view
